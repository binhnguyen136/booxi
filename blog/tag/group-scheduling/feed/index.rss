		<description><![CDATA[With Stripe, you can easily accept online payment at the time of booking, thanks to the full integration with booxi.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="float_top aligncenter wp-image-1024 size-full" src="https://booxi-live-wp-storage.storage.googleapis.com/stripe.png" alt="Stripe" width="1200" height="418" /><br />
<a href="https://stripe.com/ca" target="_blank">Stripe</a> is a very easy to use payment processor. Fully integrated with booxi, Stripe allows you to easily accept credit card online payments at the time of booking. Whether you need to capture a full payment, deposit, or a booking fee when customers book online with you, booxi made it simple for you and your customer to do so.</p>
<p>You can now choose to request an online payment for any of your services, and for both appointment bookings and group reservations. Requesting a payment can contribute in reducing no-shows, as well as simplify your cancellation fees management. This article shows you how easy it is to do it, by using Stripe.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Request a full or partial payment per service for appointments or reservations.</li>
<li>Accept online payment at booking time, or via email.</li>
<li>See which appointments or reservations have been paid in your calendar.</li>
<li>Review the payment details per appointment or reservation.</li>
<li>Charge, refund and get payment reports using Stripe.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: center"><b>Activate Your Stripe Account</b></h2>
<p>booxi supports <a href="https://stripe.com/ca" target="_blank">Stripe</a> which is one of the most trusted online payment processor. In order to start using it with booxi, you will need to create your Stripe account, and activate the Stripe module in booxi. This will enable and show the hidden online payment options in booxi.</p>
<p>Steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign in your booxi account, and click on My Business</li>
<li>Select the Business Module section, and scroll down to the Stripe module.<img class="img_zoom aligncenter size-full wp-image-1004" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/I9lOdfLXaZhoSevcM5QZKFwZ7ZJpmR6OtgL6_X-gkY5Ljb0WVxsUpQp8MDZPM4pYnqdMi5SHFY_ZqKLxjkk3HU4=s0" alt="booxi business Module" /></li>
<li>Turn the module on by clicking on the ON/OFF switch &#8211; a setup dialog will pop up.<img class="shadow_small aligncenter wp-image-1005 size-full" src="https://booxi-live-wp-storage.storage.googleapis.com/stripe-online-payment.png" alt="Stripe Online Payment" width="548" height="273" /></li>
<li>Click on Sign in Stripe, and if you already have a Stripe account, use the Sign in link at the top of the pop up dialog; if you don’t, complete the signup form underneath to create your new Stripe account.</li>
<li>To link (sign in) your existing Stripe account, simply provide your Stripe account email and password when asked, and continue with the following steps, but you must have an existing Stripe account to continue.</li>
<li>The setup dialog will ask you to provide your tax informations so we can correctly calculate taxes for your customer’s online payment. If you only have one tax, leave the second one blank and to 0%.<img class="shadow_medium aligncenter wp-image-1007 size-full" src="https://booxi-live-wp-storage.storage.googleapis.com/complete-tax-rate-configuration1.png" alt="Stripe Set up" width="603" height="848" /></li>
<li>When done click Save and you are done.</li>
</ol>
<h2 style="text-align: center">How to accept online payments with Stripe?</h2>
<p>Now that you have activated your Online Payment Module, you can choose to request a payment for any of your services, simply by adjusting their online payment settings.</p>
<ul>
<li>You will be able to request a full payment of the service, or a fix amount for example as a deposit or reservation fee.</li>
<li>This payment can be requested at the online booking, or by email just after the online booking is completed, leaving more time to pay.</li>
<li>If a customer does not complete the payment at online booking (not by email) within 15 minutes, his reservation will be automatically canceled; without requiring you to do anything.</li>
</ul>
<p>To adjust the online payment settings of a service.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to your service list and select a service for which you would like to request payment.</li>
<li>From that service profile, click on Details to open the Edit Details form on the right, and scroll down to locate the Online Payment settings (these will only be shown if you have activated your online payment processor module).</li>
<li>Select the option to request payment At Online Booking or By Email, or select Disabled (no payment requested).</li>
<li>Set the Required Payment amount, to the full amount of the service, or a fix amount, for example 10% as a deposit.</li>
<li>Click on Save, and you’re done. When a customer books an appointment online for this service, a payment will be requested.<img class="shadow_medium  aligncenter wp-image-1008 size-full" src="https://booxi-live-wp-storage.storage.googleapis.com/price-per-service.png" alt="Online Payments &amp; Booking" width="576" height="573" /></li>
</ol>
<p>Remember that if you set a required amount equal to the total service price, booxi will assume that you want to charge the service in full, so if the total to be paid varies when booking (for example multiple attendees), the total amount will be requested. Also, if you book multiple services, you can mix services that require a payment in full, partial, or even no payment, and booxi will calculate the amount in respect of each service settings.</p>
<p><i>booxi currently only support online payment for group reservations.<img class="shadow_medium alignright wp-image-1009 size-full" src="https://booxi-live-wp-storage.storage.googleapis.com/online-payment.png" alt="Stripe payment" width="301" height="483" /></i></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center"><b>Your Clients Can Pay Online in Simplicity</b></h2>
<p>When booking online, your client will be informed that a payment is required, just before confirming his booking. Once he has confirmed his booking, he will be requested to pay online using any major credit cards through the secured Stripe online payment system, within the booxi booking process.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the payment is successfully completed, the client will receive an appointment confirmation email from booxi, and a payment confirmation email from Stripe.</li>
<li>If the payment fails, the appointment will be automatically cancelled within 15 minutes, and both you and the client will be informed of that by alert and email.</li>
<li>Since communication is important here, the client must provide an email address at booking when a payment is required.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center"><b>You Can Easily Track Who Paid Online</b></h2>
<p>As clients book and complete their online required payments, you can see who paid online and track what is left to be paid.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each reservation will inform you of the current payment status and the associated balance to be paid.</li>
<li>Each appointment will indicate if a payment has been requested and completed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Color status quickly inform you of what to expect in terms of payment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bleu when a payment has been requested and you await this payment from the client.</li>
<li>Yellow when a balance is left and you need to request that payment.</li>
<li>Green when everything is paid.<img class="shadow_small aligncenter wp-image-1010 size-full" src="https://booxi-live-wp-storage.storage.googleapis.com/requested-payment.png" alt="Stripe enabled" width="291" height="83" /></li>
</ul>
<p><i>booxi currently only tracks online payment information, so you need to continue tracking payment the way you use to, while taking advantage of accepting online payment</i></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center"><b>Capture Payment in Person or Over the Phone</b></h2>
<p>For any reservation or appointment, you can process an online payment, or capture that a manual payment was completed. This means that you can complete an online payment by typing in the client’s credit card information, by send an online payment request to the client by email, or by registering that a payment was completed manually cash, or using physical payment processor terminal. This way you can track all your reservations and appointments payment status.</p>
<p>To capture payment information:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right click on an appointment or a reservation and select Pay to open the payment dialog.</li>
<li>Or open an appointment or reservation and select the top menu and option Pay.</li>
<li>You may also set a required amount for a new appointment or reservation before saving it the first time, and the Payment pop up will automatically open.</li>
</ol>
<p>To capture an online payment for your client, using his credit card information, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set the payment method to Using Stripe</li>
<li>Set the required amount</li>
<li>Click on Pay</li>
<li>The Stripe payment system will appear and complete the payment providing the client email and credit card information.</li>
<li>The payment status will change for Paid.</li>
</ol>
<p>To send a payment request email to your client, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set the payment method to By Email</li>
<li>Set the required amount</li>
<li>Click on Send.</li>
<li>The payment status will change for Awaiting the payment.</li>
</ol>
<p>To register a manual payment cash or using a payment processor terminal, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set the payment method to Manual</li>
<li>Set the required amount</li>
<li>Click on Pay.</li>
<li>The payment status will change for Paid.</li>
</ol>
<p>For each appointment and reservation, you can expand the payment status to review the details of each payment completed (using Stripe, or manual).</p>
<p><i>booxi currently only allows you to capture payment from online booking.</i></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center"><b>You Have a Complete Access to Your Transactions</b></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center"><b>and Can Do Refund</b></h2>
<p>From your Stripe dashboard, you can easily find a payment transaction, do a refund to a specific customer, and create simple transaction reports.</p>
<p>This means you can use booxi to accept online payment when clients book online; while you continue to track who paid the way you used to, and consolidate all your payments by adding the online payment report provided by Stripe.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Group Scheduling</h3>
<hr class="dash" />
<p>You must first create a service for your class or activity, as you usually do for a service appointment, except that you have to select Group Reservation for the booking type. Once the group service has been created, you can schedule group availability by adding Group Availability Time Slots in the calendar of one of your personnel.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the calendar of the personnel who offers the group service (the class or activity).</li>
<li>
<div>
<p>Right-click on a specific time slot in the calendar, or click on the Add Reservation button located at the top right of the calendar.</p>
<p><img class="border_grey border_round aligncenter wp-image-544 size-full" src="https://booxi-live-wp-storage.storage.googleapis.com/addreservation2.jpg" alt="add new group availability" width="263" height="150" /></p>
</div>
</li>
<li>If needed, adjust the personnel selection, the date and the time.</li>
<li>Select the group service to offer and if needed adjust the duration.</li>
<li>Now, adjust the capacity (maximum number of attendees).</li>
<li>Then click on Save. The group is now scheduled and customers can book online.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left">To go back and modify the group details, simply click on the group time slot in the calendar and click on the Modify button located next to the details at the top of the form.</p>
<p><img class="border_grey border_round aligncenter wp-image-545 size-full" src="https://booxi-live-wp-storage.storage.googleapis.com/modifyreservation.jpg" alt="modify group reservations" width="480" height="285" /></p>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align: center">Booking Management For a Group</h3>
<hr class="dash" />
<p>You can get reservations from online bookings and phone requests. Each online booking, and reservation request by phone will automatically reduce the number of available places. Also, each booking or reservation can include several attendees.</p>
<p><strong>List of Reservations and Attendees</strong><br />
To see the list of reservations and attendees of a group, simply open that group by clicking on its time slot in a personnel’s calendar. You will see the counts of available, booked, and total places (the capacity), followed by the list of all reservations and attendees for that group. The names of the customers who booked and the attendees will also be displayed.</p>
<p>The color of the vertical lines and icons show you the state of each reservation and attendee, where green indicates the approved ones and purple the no shows.</p>
<p><img class="img_zoom  wp-image-438" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/zTAqknpozBqemuqtNkXUTilHlvuXDNwMDqWx_GvX_gVeRnf8msHFdupIVyWabEC1rkL9uR-Qa-dPo6nAPSzldw=s0" alt="not attendee" width="16" height="16" />   Customer doesn’t participate, he only made the reservation.<br />
<img class="img_zoom  wp-image-439" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/T2HOfN8oOrgimYvWSCCwfwImG8aj53Fi7rlhIEYnN_IhfddRdZbaN3Dq3LGwwg3s1U3E8FLRlZgqR3II6gL6zw=s0" alt="attendee" width="17" height="19" />   Customer will be attending too.<br />
<img class="img_zoom  wp-image-441" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/0CxweVHK41_obG-MwYBUq-ysukqgPsYJzS6UXSgqy6pZZlumBJMRvuHzYDgfSnUm8ANRgn3_ZmxhRknizGdX=s0" alt="clientarrive" width="22" height="23" />  Attendee is present (client arrived).<br />
<img class="img_zoom  wp-image-440" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5xXxEmPGd5hPuauMCfeSdxZDq5LLSMpYjWBuQAFVRZBbT7725j9JApz_rpNkE2TDHK69YNbSI_bT8eEqN7tqOg=s0" alt="noshow" width="23" height="20" /> Attendee is missing (no-show).</p>
<p><strong>Change the Status of Reservations and Attendees</strong><br />
You can select multiple reservations and cancel them at once. You can also, once group has started, select multiple attendees and change their status to Client has arrived and No-show.</p>
<p><strong><img class="border_grey border_round aligncenter wp-image-551 size-full" src="https://booxi-live-wp-storage.storage.googleapis.com/reservationstatut.jpg" alt="group reservations status" width="478" height="416" /></strong></p>
<p>Add a Reservation<br />
You can take reservations by phone and add them in booxi by completing the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the calendar, and find the time slot associated with the desired group. Click on the group time slot to open its reservation list. You can also simply click on the New Appointment button at the top right of the calendar, and select a group service to find the desired scheduled group.</li>
<li>
<div>Then click on the  button located at the top of reservation list for this group.</div>
<p><img class="border_grey border_round aligncenter wp-image-546 size-full" src="https://booxi-live-wp-storage.storage.googleapis.com/addreservation3.jpg" alt="add a reservation" width="480" height="285" /></li>
<li>Once in the Add Reservation form, adjust the number of attendees and the price per person, if needed .</li>
<li>
<div>Click on Options to access the options allowing you to disable sending messages to the attendees (for a surprise or a gift) and to add a note with the reservation.</div>
<p><img class="border_grey border_round aligncenter wp-image-547 size-full" src="https://booxi-live-wp-storage.storage.googleapis.com/surpriseeng.jpg" alt="add reservation details" width="466" height="434" /></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 21.6px">Enter a partial name or a phone number to find the client within your client list, or complete all client information if it is a new client. booxi will automatically add the client to your client list.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 21.6px">Adjust the preferences for the reminder (by email or SMS).</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 21.6px">If the person requesting the reservation is not an attendee, you can uncheck the option Customer is attending.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 21.6px">Complete all attendees information starting with the name and optionally the email address to get a reminder by email, then the mobile phone number to get a reminder by SMS. Don’t forget to select the reminder preferences.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 21.6px"><span style="line-height: 21.6px"><span style="line-height: 21.6px"><span style="line-height: 21.6px"><span style="line-height: 21.6px"><span style="line-height: 21.6px">For each attendee, you can add a note for additional requests (such as for allergies).</span></span></span></span></span></span><img class="border_grey border_round aligncenter wp-image-548 size-full" src="https://booxi-live-wp-storage.storage.googleapis.com/additionalrequest.jpg" alt="add additional request" width="467" height="385" /></li>
<li>Once everything is completed, click on Save to add the reservation. If an error occurs, a message will appear with an an explanation. In some cases, such as when exceeding the capacity, you will have the opportunity to decide if you accept the booking anyway, or modify it.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Quickly Find a Group</h3>
<p>When you take a reservation over the phone, you can find the requested group using two different options. For example, to find the Monday 4 PM group with Nataly, you can simply open Nataly’s calendar at the requested date and immediately find the group you are looking for, or click on New Appointment and choose a group service. If you have many employees and lots of groups, the second option will be faster.</p>
<p>Here are the steps to use the second option:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the New Appointment button located at the top right of your calendar to open the new appointment form.</li>
<li><span style="line-height: 21.6px">Select a group service and the form will transform into a group search form.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 21.6px">Select a specific personnel or All personnel to see all scheduled groups.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 21.6px">Specify a starting date and time to list the groups available for the requested period.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 21.6px">Each group will be listed with a date, time, personnel and places left. Simply select the desired group.</span></li>
<li>
<div>Click on Add Reservation at the top of the form and you will be directed to the New Reservation form for that group. Now follow the steps described earlier in this article for making a new reservation.</div>
<p><img class="border_grey border_round aligncenter wp-image-549 size-full" src="https://booxi-live-wp-storage.storage.googleapis.com/group.jpg" alt="find a group availability" width="479" height="800" /></li>
</ol>
<p><strong> Attendance Record</strong><br />
You can keep the attendance record simply by selecting reservations or attendees in the list and changing their status to Client Arrived. Use the button at the top of the list to do so.</p>
<p>You can also print an attendance list using the button at the top of the list, and selection the option Print Attendance List.</p>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align: center">Online Appointment Booking for Groups</h3>
<hr class="dash" />
<p>Your customers will now be able to easily book online with you for one or many attendees, from your booxi page, facebook or your website. To do so, they will have to complete the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the Book Now button.</li>
<li><span style="line-height: 21.6px">Select the desired group service (or activity).</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 21.6px">Adjust the number of attendees.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 21.6px">Select a date.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 21.6px">Select a time among the time slots that you have scheduled.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 21.6px">Complete the client information, as it’s done for usual appointment.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 21.6px">If the client choose to make a reservation for someone else, or if there is more than one attendee, the customer will have to complete the required information for each attendee.</span></li>
<li>
<div>For each attendee, enter a full name, and optionally an email address or a mobile phone number, preferences for the reminder (by email or SMS) and if needed, add an additional request.</div>
<p><img class="border_grey border_round aligncenter wp-image-550 size-full" src="https://booxi-live-wp-storage.storage.googleapis.com/onlinereservation.jpg" alt="group reservation online" width="940" height="564" /></li>
</ol>
<p>The client who made the reservation will then receive a confirmation, and the attendees will receive a reminder by email or SMS. Finally, with booxi it’s easy to manage reservations for group activities.</p>
