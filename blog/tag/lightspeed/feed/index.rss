<p>While booxi is all about appointment management and customer relations, it does not provide point of sale features such as invoicing and inventory management; which is why booxi has partnered with Lightspeed, a top class Point Of Sale (POS) solution.</p>
<h3>We Provide a User-Friendly Integration With Lightspeed Retail POS</h3>
<p>Integrate booxi with Lightspeed Retail, and you obtain a featureful solution, which among many features, offers:</p>
<ul>
<li>A synchronized customer management (same customers in both solutions)</li>
<li>Scheduling and appointment tracking (with booxi)</li>
<li>Easy invoicing (sales or work orders) for appointments (a service), where you can add on products and discounts</li>
<li>Automated communications with your customers (with booxi)</li>
<li>Link services to sales item, and personnel to employees</li>
<li>Inventory management</li>

</ul>
<p>The combined solution is very efficient and easy to use, thanks to its data synchronisation and simplicity to switch from appointments to sales in their respective browser tabs. You can right-click on an appointment in booxi and choose to create an invoice in Lightspeed Retail. booxi takes care of creating the Lightspeed customer if it is not already there, it creates an invoice, and adds the item associated with the provided service, all done automatically. You can then add more products to the sale, or close it right away. It is fast and efficient.</p>

<li>Click on Sign-in to Lightspeed.</li>
<li>A pop up will ask for your Lightspeed credentials (email and password) used to Login your Lightspeed account. If valid, booxi will display your account number and a choice of shops and registers.

<li>Select one of your services from the list.</li>
<li>Click on Service Details.<img class="shadow_medium aligncenter wp-image-311" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/s5QNqLTH31KUYk-7VOFpuhgSREseLrNb0YRufgJEUDlxY0Q5yf9wGe-gaYJU9NX5lUp-RDQ_czEl9joTMfWHEQ=s1024" alt="services details" width="850" height="539" /></li>
<li>At the top of the Service Details form, you should see a selection of sale items (Link with Lightspeed). Choose the associated item that should appear in a sale when this service is given.<img class="shadow_medium aligncenter wp-image-312" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Gn9TppCeEAhsP8co2Tg2GiVqzriLDa651tRUEZAStLYorxjaxH5fRxfWsJ4JRqqm68FxvNkLsHgBM8mbZ_ca=s1024" alt="services details lightspeed" width="650" height="674" /></li>
<li>Click on Save to keep your changes or Undo to cancel.<br />
<img class="shadow_medium aligncenter wp-image-310 size-full" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CGGj2lc-odtNiN-qC_qUCNyZ8jocQPSdXLYazTiOW9191KEr0AhlV1kQZMhCyv5EpLDJ5D0eI8vNNth8wVZriw=s0" alt="save" width="257" height="61" /></li>
<li>Repeat those steps to link all your services to different sale items. If you do not see a selection of non inventory sale items, it is because your Lightspeed module has not been activated.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Step 3 &#8211; Associate Personnel to Lightspeed Employees</h3>

<li>At the top of the Personnel Details form, you should see a selection of employees (Link with Lightspeed). Choose the associated employee that should appear in a sale when this member of your personnel provides a service.<img class="shadow_medium aligncenter wp-image-314 size-full" src="http://booxi-live-wp-storage.storage.googleapis.com/personnel-details-lightspeed.jpg" alt="personnel details lightspeed" width="557" height="468" /></li>
<li>Click on Save to keep your changes or Undo to cancel.<img class="shadow_medium aligncenter wp-image-310 size-full" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CGGj2lc-odtNiN-qC_qUCNyZ8jocQPSdXLYazTiOW9191KEr0AhlV1kQZMhCyv5EpLDJ5D0eI8vNNth8wVZriw=s0" alt="save" width="257" height="61" /></li>
<li>Repeat those steps to link all members of your personnel to different employees. If you do not see a selection of employees, it is because your Lightspeed module has not been activated.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Step 4 &#8211; Create a Lightspeed sale from a booxi appointment</h3>
<p>Now that you have setup booxi to work with Lightspeed, you can create a sale for each appointment.</p>
<ol>
<li>From the main menu located on the left side of the page, click on Calendar.</li>
<li>Select an appointment.</li>
<li>Right click on the appointment for which you want to make a sale and select the option New Lightspeed Sale.<img class="shadow_medium aligncenter wp-image-315 size-full" src="http://booxi-live-wp-storage.storage.googleapis.com/menu.jpg" alt="menu" width="495" height="552" /><img class="shadow_medium aligncenter wp-image-316 size-full" src="http://booxi-live-wp-storage.storage.googleapis.com/lightspeed-sale.png" alt="lightspeed sale" width="607" height="797" /></li>
<li>The member of your Personnel providing the service will be set with the appointment details by default, you may change it.</li>
<li>The Service is also set with the appointment details value if the service was linked to a sale item, if not, you may select a non inventory item and link them.</li>
<li>The Client information will be set to the appointment’s client details. If booxi could not find a client match in your Lightspeed customers, you will be able to tell booxi to add this client to your Lightspeed customers.<br />
<img class="shadow_medium aligncenter wp-image-320 size-full" src="http://booxi-live-wp-storage.storage.googleapis.com/add-customer.png" alt="add customer" width="518" height="84" /></li>
<li>You may change the default Register in which the sale will be created.</li>
<li>By default, the employee creating the sale is the current booxi user, you may change the employee selection (Sold by).</li>
<li>Click on Create Sale to create the sale in Lightspeed and change browser window to complete the sale using Lightspeed.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Step 5 &#8211; Create a work order in Lightspeed from a booxi appointment</h3>
<p>Unlike the sales, Lightspeed do not provide APIs to create work orders, so we simply save you time by opening Lightspeed with the right customer, and ready to create the work order yourself. So even though this option is called create work order, it actualy does not create it for you, but instead, save you time on the creating process.</p>
<ol>
<li>From the main menu located on the left side of the page, click on Calendar.</li>
<li>Select an appointment.</li>
<li>Right click on the appointment for which you want to create a work order and select the option New Lightspeed Work Order.<img class="shadow_medium aligncenter wp-image-318 size-full" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vliJRIPdWTe0o7UreeYVEopVs79H57Vxr5bSsz17iihYNb4Gj3bpubWOyTAjQ9MktvcvaywY2UboX-CWCaVtOg=s0" alt="work order" width="495" height="552" /><br />
<img class="shadow_medium aligncenter wp-image-319 size-full" src="http://booxi-live-wp-storage.storage.googleapis.com/lightsdpeed1.png" alt="lightsdpeed" width="607" height="492" /></li>
<li>The following pop-up appears.<br />
If the customer is already link between Lightspeed and booxi all you have to do is to click on New Work Order.<br />
<span style="line-height: 21.6px">If the customer doesn’t exist in Lightspeed, the option Add a new customer in Lightspeed appears. Click on New Work Order.<br />
<img class="shadow_medium aligncenter wp-image-317 size-full" style="color: #000000" src="http://booxi-live-wp-storage.storage.googleapis.com/add-a-new-customer-in-lightspeed.png" alt="add a new customer in lightspeed" width="536" height="86" /><br />
</span></li>
<li>Complete the Work Order like you usually do in Lightspeed.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Step 6 &#8211; Import Your Lightspeed Customers in booxi</h3>
<p>Even though booxi allows you to match a booxi client with a Lightspeed customer every time you make a sale or you create a work order, you may want to import all your Lightspeed customer in booxi at once, and do the matching in advance to save time on the long run.</p>
<ol>
<li>From the main menu located on the left side of the page, click on the tab Client.</li>
<li>Then click on the Options Icon</li>
<li>And select Import from Lightspeed.<img class="shadow_medium aligncenter wp-image-321" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pZ921idbGyZClo4UbkTxEBvwp2HzTTeAQK2sYFo7m4mhv47SoYEI7gPoXCqOtGIiziWXlQJt78PcUJxZAfmIzg=s0" alt="import Lightspeed" width="750" height="421" /></li>
<li>This pop-up will appear. Click on the button Import Customers, and the import will be instantly done.<img class="shadow_medium aligncenter wp-image-322" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/HNK4Y_bKaLXkypWB51uWifXxvC_W72sDylqanI8jIxb2q8EbbLw8VQT6afTld2yltsQWXNKxzNzZ18YWCRuH=s0" alt="import" width="650" height="456" /></li>
<li>And you’re done.</li>
</ol>
