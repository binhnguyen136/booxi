<p><span style="line-height: 21.6px">In one hand, most of appointment management softwares based on computer are outdated and no longer meet the customers’ needs, which have evolved.<br />
</span><span style="line-height: 21.6px">On the other hand they are very expensive, they do not allow collaborative work nor data access at anytime.</span></p>
<p>It is therefore time to adapt your business to provide your customers what they are looking for. This change is cloud based management software!</p>
<h3>1 &#8211; Accessible from any device</h3>
<p>Cloud solutions are often accessible from different devices such as computer, tablet and smartphone.</p>
<p>Imagine the following scenario: You have just arrived in your business, you have appointments scheduled all day long and not a minute to lose. And here comes the drama : Your computer doesn’t boot. And there might be numerous reasons (power cut, virus on your computer, update necessary that will put 3 hours&#8230;).</p>
<p>With a cloud-based solution, you can immediately access to your customer records and appointments from your tablet or smartphone since all the data are stored in the cloud.</p>
<h3>2 &#8211; Accessible from anywhere</h3>
<p>Some expensive solutions allow you to access your business computer remotely, but it has to be in use, while a cloud solution gives you access to your data at any time, wherever you are and with a complete safety.</p>
<p>You can even give a limited access to employees. They will be able to access their calendar directly from their smartphone. Then they will stop to call you to ask about their schedules and their appointments. It is the same for you : enjoy more freedom with your handy calendar, wherever you are.</p>
<h3>3 &#8211; It’s less expensive</h3>
<p>While you will have to spend a start-up cost to install software and then pay a monthly fee, cloud solutions usually don’t require start-up fees nor installation. Just pay your monthly or yearly fee to enjoy this tool. Most of the solutions offer very advantageous prices, according to your needs and your budget.</p>

<h3>4 &#8211; Increased security for your peace of mind</h3>
<p>If unfortunately you have been robbed, a fire breaks out or simply the hard drive of your computer breaks, you could lose all your data. Are your backup copies always tested and updated &#8230;?</p>
<p>Cloud-based solutions usually have automatic and instant backups. It is therefore impossible to lose your data. Also, if your computer is robbed, or if you lose your smartphone, no data are stored on any device, they remain in the cloud.</p>
<p>Here are several examples of cloud solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Online Appointment Booking — booxi</li>
<li>POS — Lightspeed</li>
<li>Accounting Software — Quickbooks</li>
<li>Email Access — GMail</li>
</ul>
<h3>5 - Answers the market demand</h3>
<p>Cloud-based solution generally provides features more adapted to the client today, which are at the same time features that greatly benefit to you. For example with booxi enjoy :</p>
<ul>
<li>Online booking appointment — Customers love that and you save a lot of time off the phone.</li>
<li><span style="line-height: 21.6px">Confirmations by email — Customers have all the information they need.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 21.6px">Reminders by email and SMS  — Less no-shows, and more happy clients.</span></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<blockquote><p> To conclude, cloud-based solution allows you to save time and money while your customers enjoy it and all your data are secured.</p></blockquote>

</ul>
<hr />
<p>Some of us are afraid of storing data on a remote computer, because we hear stories and we lack knowledge of how these things work. This article will help you understand how it works and how safe is your data with booxi.</p>
<h3>Hackers and viruses</h3>
<p>We all hear stories about criminal hackers, spyware, software viruses, stolen credit card numbers, and data or pictures leaked on the Internet. The reality is that most of these things take place on your computer, not in the cloud. Criminal hackers use various techniques which can easily be avoided by developing some simple habits to protect your computer, or accounts from being hacked. I would say that the cloud is much safer than your own computer, as long as you don’t give up your credentials (username and password).</p>
<h3>The Cloud</h3>
<p>What is the cloud? Imagine a series of computers with lots of data storage capacity for which the access is highly secured. Let say that when you access a website, only the user interface runs on your computer, the application runs on a remote computer, and for that reason, if your computer breaks, the website is not lost, it remains on the remote computer (or server) and you can still access it from any computer. The concept is similar with the cloud, where if you use cloud storage, your data are stored on a remote server, or if you use a web application or service, that application runs on a remote server. In fact, if you have a facebook account, you are a cloud computing service user. Other example of cloud services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your email account (outlook, gmail and others)</li>
<li>Google docs</li>
<li>Social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest)</li>
<li>Banking portals</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-23 size-full" src="https://booxi-live-wp-storage.storage.googleapis.com/422493-best-cloud-storage-solutions.jpg" alt="cloud accessible from all devices" width="740" height="417" /></p>
<h3>The Benefits</h3>
<p>There are many benefits of using cloud service like booxi, which explains its growing popularity. As a starter: it prevents you from losing data; it provides more flexibility for the accessibility of your data; and it allows you to share data in the most convenient ways. <strong>Safe and Secure</strong> <img class="alignright wp-image-24 size-medium" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WB-xyMnMXbrW1WfgyuECuujeyxT5vf75riqWhZmf_oBGsd0W0g0OVaGnyNPjWk_yyMBWDRkXrNdtFuPlbDS8nA=s300" alt="secure cloud computing" width="300" height="300" /> The access to your data is password protected. Only you, who know your password can access your booxi account and your data. No one can see your password, not even booxi&#8217;s customer support and software developers, as it is encrypted in our databases. No need to do backups. If your computer, tablet or smartphone is broken or stolen, you will not loose anything as nothing was on it. You can simply connect from a new computer and retrieve everything. <strong>Accessible</strong> Your data is centralized, which means you can access it from various devices at any time. You can also share the experience with members of your personnel, making it a team effort. <strong>No service interruption</strong> Another very important thing is that you get no service interruption, as you can rapidly access everything from your smartphone, a tablet or another computer in the event that your business computer stops working.</p>
<h3>Things to remember:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Your data is secured with your password.</li>
<li>You will never loose your data, so no backup is required.</li>
<li>No interruption of service, since you can access it from various device.</li>
<li>You can share booxi with your team.</li>
</ul>
