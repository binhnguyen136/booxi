		<description><![CDATA[No shows are a waste of time and money. Here are solutions to avoid them.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="float_top shadow_large aligncenter wp-image-171 size-full" src="https://booxi-live-wp-storage.storage.googleapis.com/Hair_Salon_No_Show_EN.png" alt="find solution to avoid no-shows" width="1199" height="600" /></p>
<p>But you can easily prevent them, and this article covers the 3 most efficient ways to avoid no-shows.</p>
<h3>1 &#8211; Charge Cancellation Fees</h3>
<p>Although it may not suit all businesses and it may not be for you, charging a cancellation fee remains the most effective option. But it also requires important efforts on your part, and it may scare clients away. This method has proven to be effective for businesses that have a long waiting list to get an appointment with those.</p>
<p>We are basically talking about asking your client’s credit card via the phone, or via online appointment booking (if you use an appointment management solution). You can request a deposit or a full payment.</p>
<p><span class="bx_text14" style="color: #ffffff;background-color: #44ce5e;padding: 2px 8px"><strong>PROS</strong></span></p>
<p>The customer will show up for sure, and if he does not, you still get paid.</p>
<p><span class="bx_text14" style="color: #ffffff;background-color: #ff7070;padding: 2px 8px"><strong>CONS</strong></span></p>
<p>Not all clients will be comfortable to give your their credit card number over the phone, and many will not book online because a credit card is required.</p>
<p><span class="bx_text14" style="color: #ffffff;background-color: #33bcf2;padding: 2px 8px"><strong>ALTERNATIVE</strong></span></p>
<p>Let them book online, and ask their credit card in the confirmation email; using a secure payment method. Some appointment management solutions supports this. This way you do not have to ask the credit card over the phone, and the client will complete the online booking as no credit card will be asked at this time. If the payment is not completed, at least you know that your client wants an appointment, and you can contact him to complete the transaction. Make sure to make it clear that a prepayment is required.</p>
<h3>2 &#8211; Reminding Your Customers</h3>
<p>If we combine the efficiency with the customer experience factors, reminding your clients is truly the best option. Although if you plan on doing this manually by calling each client, it represents a huge time investment; while there are simple ways to automate this.</p>
<p>Some appointment management solutions automatically send email or SMS reminders a few hours or a day before the appointment; no matter if the appointment was taken online, or by phone. This means you cover almost 100% of your appointments, leaving you with only a few calls to make, or very few no-shows.</p>
<p><span class="bx_text16 bx_text14" style="color: #ffffff;background-color: #44ce5e;padding: 2px 8px"><strong>PROS</strong></span></p>
<p>You have nothing to do, or little efforts; your clients love reminders, and they show up.</p>
<p><span class="bx_text14" style="color: #ffffff;background-color: #ff7070;padding: 2px 8px"><strong>CONS</strong></span></p>
<p>You have to quite using a paper calendar and work more efficiently. Solutions are not free, but some starts at $9 per month which is nothing compare to the hours and hundreds of dollars you lose every month because of no-shows.</p>
<h3>3 &#8211; Follow Up After a No-Show</h3>
<p>You can develop the habit of calling back clients for each no-show, so they have to explain themselves, and feel guilty enough to double their attention next time they have an appointment with you. This method will help prevent some no-shows, but is far from being as efficient as the other two methods.</p>
<p>Some appointment management solutions will send automatically an email to no-show clients reminding them of your cancellation policies, so you do not need to call them.</p>
<p><span class="bx_text16 bx_text14" style="color: #ffffff;background-color: #44ce5e;padding: 2px 8px"><strong>PROS</strong></span></p>
<p>Helps sensitize your clients about no-shows.</p>
<p><span class="bx_text14" style="color: #ffffff;background-color: #ff7070;padding: 2px 8px"><strong>CONS</strong></span></p>
<p>It does not help preventing no-shows.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote><p> Clearly the best solution that fits all businesses is a combination of #2 and #3, which requires you to use an appointment solution.</p></blockquote>

<p style="text-align: justify">Managing appointments is all about communication, and booxi enables you to communicate easily and clearly with your clients in a way that increases the quality level of your service and saves you lots of time.<br />
<img class="alignright wp-image-104" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/i79hdnbLe1le6Nx0o1HrmJ6rfCgW7bXcURhYIVSpYWEjKp-hhfLKqOXFzqRFT6S3K8paExlsMhj5BIBIx7PUAw=s0" alt="Confirmation Email with booxi" width="409" height="560" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">From the moment you book for a client or a client self-book an appointment with you using booxi, the communication flow starts with the objective of informing and assisting your client. Messages are automatically sent via email or SMS, and no effort is required on your part, although you still have control over this. The choice of email or SMS is determined by the client preferences and the importance of the message.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">These preferences can be specified by you when you book an appointment for your client or by your client when he self-books online. You may also modified these preferences in your client record.</p>
<h3>What messages does booxi send?</h3>
<p>booxi sends messages according to the appointment’s status, so clients always receive comprehensive messages such as confirmation, rescheduling, cancellation, reminders and other notifications. We have included a list of the most important messages at the end of this article.</p>
<p>Some messages will ask your client to confirm a time or a change, while others will simply inform your client, providing him with the possibility of rescheduling or cancelling the appointment. These messages include buttons (with web links) for your client to use, to perform these actions, and instantly notify you in booxi. These simple options will save you valuable time off the phone.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your clients get all appointment details handy.</li>
<li>They can modify or cancel an appointment (optionally).</li>
<li>You can add notes to any appointment to inform your client.</li>
<li>You can get them to confirm without picking up the phone.</li>
</ul>
<h3>When are messages sent?</h3>
<p>Confirmation and notification messages are sent as soon as the appointment changes while reminders are sent at a specific time, which you can configure.</p>
<p>A confirmation is sent when you approve an appointment request, and notifications are sent whenever you modify, reschedule or cancel an appointment with the option to notify the client (which is by default).</p>
<ul>
<li>You can change the delay for the reminder (by default it is 24 hours before the appointment).</li>
<li>You can decide for each appointment to send or not send a notification message (by default, it won&#8217;t send it).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reminders</strong></p>
<p>Sending reminders to your clients is one of the most effective ways to prevent no shows. Every time an appointment is booked using booxi, you make sure the client will show up.</p>
<p>Both email and SMS reminders provide the time and the address of the appointment which also saves you time, since statistics shows that many customers call to get the address just before their appointments.</p>
<p><strong>Messages</strong></p>
<p>Here is a list of some of the messages booxi sends.</p>
