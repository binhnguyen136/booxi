				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center"><img class="float_top aligncenter wp-image-609 size-full" src="https://booxi-live-wp-storage.storage.googleapis.com/SpaShow2016_post.jpg" alt="appointment sms reminder" width="1200" height="600" />October 16th and 17th, booxi was at the Esthetique Spa International and Daniel Laplante, our CEO, was one of the speakers.</h2>
<p><div class="creativ-shortcode creativ-shortcode-cols  creativ-shortcode-cols-half-half "></div><div class="creativ-shortcode creativ-shortcode-col creativ-shortcode-col-a"><div class="creativ-shortcode-col-inner"><p>The conference “How to Get More Revenues With Less Efforts : using simple and affordable online tools” was a success with a room that was full. M. Laplante was talking about the market statistics, trends, tools, and simple methods to get more results with less efforts. A set of tips easy to apply and providing amazing results.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-621" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/08YVo-RREDMKr0eNTjFyZwmOp1W6j-O8i_QDWRIw-S3nEStawaJffMWBlt28vY-Q_-hRp5Oe2s-vsNWb4RSs6A=s0" alt="daniel laplante" width="300" height="275" /></p>
</div></div><div class="creativ-shortcode creativ-shortcode-col creativ-shortcode-col-b"><div class="creativ-shortcode-col-inner"></div></div><br />
Your customers are online, you have to be there too. Which is why the conference was talking about tools adapted, affordable and easy to use.</p>
<hr class="dash" />
<p>We were there at our booth to answer questions about our smart appointment booking solution. It was also a privilege to receive some of our users, who wanted to share their experience with us, and to learn that they cannot imagine a life without booxi anymore.</p>

<td><strong>A Revenue Increase of Over $6000</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>For example, one of our customers saw her revenues increase by over $6000 in the last year, by avoiding no-shows (which she estimated to be 3 per week). 3 appointments * $40 = $120 *50 weeks = $6000. With a cost of $400, her return on investment for using booxi has been largely proven.</p>

<td><strong>A Competitive Advantage, That Also Saves a Lot of Time</strong></td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Another customer explained to us that since she started offering online appointment booking, many customers from her competition became her customers because they like online appointment booking and SMS reminders. A crucial competitive advantage, that in addition of saving you time, will also attract new customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Don’t waste time anymore, enjoy the benefits provided by booxi and easily increase your revenues</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="float_top shadow_large aligncenter wp-image-360 size-full" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/GhcZhwYtr4idtL68KNiCkYLV8W_pzTsV0llAxECwzG9jUsOrEQasd1fDLiZEnvJyxo98O4pql_hoQYJnolxd=s0" alt="Loreal_Cover4" width="1200" height="600" /></p>
<p>On May 12th 2016, booxi participated to the successful Hair Fashion Night in Toronto event organized by L&#8217;Oréal Professionnel. With a progressive opening of places and with more than 700 appointments made in only 4 days, the event was rapidly sold out.</p>
<p>In order to support this complex logistic of automatically assigning attendees to one of the 50 stylists, according to the available time slots per stylist, L&#8217;Oréal Professionnel has chosen booxi.</p>
<p>Attendees were able to reserve online from the L’Oréal Professionnel booxi page, Facebook and a custom mobile app, then receive a confirmation by email with their designated time and stylist. A major time savings for the organizers, and a great experience for the participants.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="bx_text24">Appointment online booking was suspended because all time slots were filled, and resumed 3 days later, following the opening of 150 new spaces by L&#8217;Oréal Professionnel.</span></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><span class="bx_text24">The event was a success and booxi is happy to have helped a company as large as L&#8217;Oréal Professionnel, as it daily supports SMEs and self-employed workers.</span></p></blockquote>
