				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center"><img class="float_top aligncenter wp-image-609 size-full" src="https://booxi-live-wp-storage.storage.googleapis.com/SpaShow2016_post.jpg" alt="appointment sms reminder" width="1200" height="600" />October 16th and 17th, booxi was at the Esthetique Spa International and Daniel Laplante, our CEO, was one of the speakers.</h2>
<p><div class="creativ-shortcode creativ-shortcode-cols  creativ-shortcode-cols-half-half "></div><div class="creativ-shortcode creativ-shortcode-col creativ-shortcode-col-a"><div class="creativ-shortcode-col-inner"><p>The conference “How to Get More Revenues With Less Efforts : using simple and affordable online tools” was a success with a room that was full. M. Laplante was talking about the market statistics, trends, tools, and simple methods to get more results with less efforts. A set of tips easy to apply and providing amazing results.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-621" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/08YVo-RREDMKr0eNTjFyZwmOp1W6j-O8i_QDWRIw-S3nEStawaJffMWBlt28vY-Q_-hRp5Oe2s-vsNWb4RSs6A=s0" alt="daniel laplante" width="300" height="275" /></p>
</div></div><div class="creativ-shortcode creativ-shortcode-col creativ-shortcode-col-b"><div class="creativ-shortcode-col-inner"></div></div><br />
Your customers are online, you have to be there too. Which is why the conference was talking about tools adapted, affordable and easy to use.</p>
<hr class="dash" />
<p>We were there at our booth to answer questions about our smart appointment booking solution. It was also a privilege to receive some of our users, who wanted to share their experience with us, and to learn that they cannot imagine a life without booxi anymore.</p>
<table style="height: auto;margin-bottom: 0px">

<tr>
<td style="width: 50px !important"><img class="img_zoom size-full wp-image-726 alignleft" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/zjbgVl3skHLg0VgGdwrswiswhfO3NqyPVqnOMIg-xIuJ0HO3F3njrh458bHJg9HhBH220UGgnwY-NEwQeQJn=s0" alt="affiliate_b" width="40" height="40" /></td>
<td><strong>A Revenue Increase of Over $6000</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>For example, one of our customers saw her revenues increase by over $6000 in the last year, by avoiding no-shows (which she estimated to be 3 per week). 3 appointments * $40 = $120 *50 weeks = $6000. With a cost of $400, her return on investment for using booxi has been largely proven.</p>
<table style="height: auto;margin-bottom: 0px">

<td><strong>A Competitive Advantage, That Also Saves a Lot of Time</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Another customer explained to us that since she started offering online appointment booking, many customers from her competition became her customers because they like online appointment booking and SMS reminders. A crucial competitive advantage, that in addition of saving you time, will also attract new customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Don’t waste time anymore, enjoy the benefits provided by booxi and easily increase your revenues</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="float_top shadow_large aligncenter wp-image-360 size-full" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/GhcZhwYtr4idtL68KNiCkYLV8W_pzTsV0llAxECwzG9jUsOrEQasd1fDLiZEnvJyxo98O4pql_hoQYJnolxd=s0" alt="Loreal_Cover4" width="1200" height="600" /></p>
<p>On May 12th 2016, booxi participated to the successful Hair Fashion Night in Toronto event organized by L&#8217;Oréal Professionnel. With a progressive opening of places and with more than 700 appointments made in only 4 days, the event was rapidly sold out.</p>
<p>In order to support this complex logistic of automatically assigning attendees to one of the 50 stylists, according to the available time slots per stylist, L&#8217;Oréal Professionnel has chosen booxi.</p>
<p>Attendees were able to reserve online from the L’Oréal Professionnel booxi page, Facebook and a custom mobile app, then receive a confirmation by email with their designated time and stylist. A major time savings for the organizers, and a great experience for the participants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="bx_text24">Appointment online booking was suspended because all time slots were filled, and resumed 3 days later, following the opening of 150 new spaces by L&#8217;Oréal Professionnel.</span></p></blockquote>

		<description><![CDATA[booxi was at the Vancouver ESI 2016. This overview highlights the great feedback received during the event.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><img class="float_top aligncenter" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-c-3z2Wuwl4U/VuxImJKXE8I/AAAAAAAAAE0/mR49JG1kax8VOos_zXMsk48Z1L4b5iKSA/s640/SHOW.PNG" alt="booxi founders" width="640" height="507" />booxi was at the 2016 Vancouver EIS (Esthetic SPA International) show at the beginning of March showcasing booxi to professionals from BC and the surroundings.</strong></p>
<p>The feedback we got was amazing and unanimous from the roughly 500 professionals we met with. They were surprised by the simplicity and pricing of booxi, as well as how fast they can start using it and how soon they start benefiting from it.</p>
<p>Professionals visiting EIS don’t really expect to see software in this type of trade show, they are mainly here for beauty products, equipment and new technologies or discovery and sessions for their industry. When they see software, they are reluctant thinking it is about website design, or expensive Salon system or Marketing tools. They don’t expect to find something like booxi that completely changes the game for them.</p>
<p>Even though they think this is not for them; within the first 30 seconds we talk to them, we describe the problems they face for which they all agree by saying that it is even worst, then when we start explaining the solution we have for them, they get very excited. Finally when we show the pricing, the reaction is always the same “Are you … serious!”. The entire two days were like that none stop, so it was very rewarding for us to see the reaction and how people saw us as their salvation.</p>
<p>For students who were planning on starting their own business, it was a true revelation. They will now be able to start their business without spending $3,000 to $8,000 for a website, a POS and computers. With a little budget of $17 to $34 a month ($200 to $400 a year) they’ll have everything they need including the website, the CRM, the appointment solution, the automated email and SMS and more. They will be more effective than most established businesses on day one and be able to focus on doing what they love the most: spending time with customers.</p>

<h3>We Provide a User-Friendly Integration With Lightspeed Retail POS</h3>
<p>Integrate booxi with Lightspeed Retail, and you obtain a featureful solution, which among many features, offers:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>The combined solution is very efficient and easy to use, thanks to its data synchronisation and simplicity to switch from appointments to sales in their respective browser tabs. You can right-click on an appointment in booxi and choose to create an invoice in Lightspeed Retail. booxi takes care of creating the Lightspeed customer if it is not already there, it creates an invoice, and adds the item associated with the provided service, all done automatically. You can then add more products to the sale, or close it right away. It is fast and efficient.</p>
